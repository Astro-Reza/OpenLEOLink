        Hi! Thank you for visiting this site. I built this platform as a dedicated tool to deepen
        my understanding of link budget calculations and satellite communication parameters.
        Here, I compile research, simulate signal losses, and analyze the mathematics behind
        LEO and multi-orbit networks. I hope you find these resources as useful as I do.

        In general, Palatine Technologies is more like a personal sandbox to me. In Palatine,
        I put all of my personal projects, where I use it as a practical tool to learn.
        My goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical papers and practical applications.
        If you have any suggestions for future updates of this site please let me know, thank you!
    </p>
